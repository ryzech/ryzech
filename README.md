Hey there! I'm Ryz! Don't need to know much about me, but if you're here I suppose you want to.

I love programming, as it's one of my favourite hobbies, but as well as that, Video Editing and Content Creation, aswell as Art (Mostly pixel art these days!) are my other hobbies.

But enough about me.

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, this is not an exhaustive list but just an idea.

<details>
  <summary>About StaffChat</summary>
  
  StaffChat is a Velocity plugin I made to bridge a private chat for server staff (or for any other reason), to Discord. If you send a message starting with `@`, or enable auto with `/sctoggle`, it will send a message to a configurable Discord channel, using a Discord bot. And if you send a message in the Discord channel, it will send it in Minecraft privately!
