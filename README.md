Hey there! I'm Ryz! Don't need to know much about me, but if you're here I suppose you want to.

I love programming, as it's one of my favourite hobbies, but as well as that, Video Editing and Content Creation, aswell as Art (Mostly pixel art these days!) are my other hobbies.

But enough about me.
