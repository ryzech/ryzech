Hey there! I'm Ryz! I mainly use C#, and Java on GitHub, but I use C++ BTS a lot aswell :D

I love programming, as it's one of my favourite hobbies, but as well as that, Video Editing and Content Creation, aswell as Art (Started drawing around half a year ago) are my other hobbies!

But enough about me, let's move onto my actual GitHub stuff :p

  <summary>About StaffChat</summary>
  
  StaffChat is a Velocity plugin I made to bridge a private chat for server staff (or for any other reason), to Discord. If you send a message starting with `@`, or enable auto with `/sctoggle`, it will send a message to a configurable Discord channel, using a Discord bot. And if you send a message in the Discord channel, it will send it in Minecraft privately!

  <summary>About SmpCore</summary>
  
  SmpCore is a plugin I made for my Minecraft server (`legundo.mcserver.us` though its down for a reset as of now). Not anything special, but it adds some things I needed for our server (Diamond backed economy system (uses essentials economy api), report command using MySQL and a Discord bot to notify us of reports, spawn commands, announcement command, and a few other things). If you find anything useful feel free to use it :D Keep in mind though, this is made for my server, so while its configurable to be used on ANY server, it may not 100% fit your needs. If you have any issues however, feel free to open an issue, or open pull requests to add or fix things!
