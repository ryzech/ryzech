  ## [SmpCore](https://github.com/ryzech/SmpCore)
  SmpCore is a private plugin I made for my SMP server on minecraft! It just adds some things i thought would be useful. (Showing how much damage an attack does, disabling join and/or leave messages, spawn command, etc) If you want to help, shoot me a message!
